# Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (scipy implementation)
**warning: this project is not mature, think before using it.**


Code is base on QAOA paper, [Farhi, E., Goldstone, J., & Gutmann, S. (2014). A Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028).
Code is partly referenced from [minimum vertex cover problem](https://github.com/sam-marsh/Vertex-Cover-QAOA) project.

## Features:
* max-cut problem and vertex cover problem,
* improved performance (with respect to Vertex-Cover-QAOA),
* general purposed,
* projectq support.
